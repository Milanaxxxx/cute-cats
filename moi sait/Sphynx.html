		<b>Despite an appearance that some consider repulsive
		</b>, Sphynx cats are one of the friendliest breeds in the world. The Sphynx, which gets its smooth skin as a result of a genetic mutation <b>(though not all varieties are completely hairless)</b>, is suitable for families with children and other pets.
		<br>Sphynxes also love to spend time with dogs! According to the Cat Fanciers' Association,
		<b>"they are extremely affectionate, known for their silly antics and appear downright clumsy when trying to be the center of attention."</b> Sphynx cats are energetic and playful and love to impress their owners. They have very different grooming needs than animals with fur, so if a Sphynx cat wants to stay warm, she will snuggle up to you or other pets.
