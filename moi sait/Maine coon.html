<font size="5" face="Comic Sans MS"> The rating of the friendliest breeds is headed by the <b>Maine Coon.</b>
	<br>Don't let her large size scare you: she has a wonderful, easy-going character, so she is suitable even for a family with small children.
	<br>The Maine Coon's long, silky coat requires special care and will take up a lot of your time, but it will help strengthen your friendship with your pet.
